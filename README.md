# DockerShip

## Getting Started

1. Install all Python deps in `requirements.txt`.
2. `cd web` and run `pnpm install`.
3. Open two terminals, one for Python script and one for the web app.
4. In the Python terminal run `python main.py true`. This will run the eel environment on port 8080.
5. In the web app terminal run `npm start`.
6. View the UI in the browser at `localhost:3000`.

## Notes

If you make a change to `main.py` you need to restart the script and reload the web app.
